# **Review Functions**
Along with the tools for retrieval and annotation of corpus data, Cosycat includes the tools for review and early analysis of annotations
entered by the user. This allows all members of the project to review and assess any given set of annotations in a searchable format in 
order to determine their relevancy, examine their distribution and raise issues for correction or discussion.

## **Review Frame**
The Review Frame is the primary interface for the retrieval and analysis of annotations, with a variety of tools to achieve this. This
interface is accessed through the menu bar and exhibits a similar UI to the query pane, with 9 primary elements to contrain search results.

1. **AnnKey Searchbox:** This and the corresponding AnnValue Searchbox are the primary method of retrieving annotation data from the database.
By entering the text of any key entered into the data elsewhere in Cosycat these corresponding data are retrieved in the Review Frame.
Checking the corresponding tickbox uses the text entered as a regex, searching annotations in the database for matching results in the same 
manner as regex searches in the query functions. This function can be used alone or along with the AnnValue Searchbox.

2. **AnnValue Searchbox:** This and the corresponding AnnKey Searchbox are the primary method of retrieving annotation data from the database.
By entering the text of any value entered into the data elsewhere in Cosycat these corresponding data are retrieved in the Review Frame.
Checking the corresponding tickbox uses the text entered as a regex, searching annotations in the database for matching results in the same 
manner as regex searches in the query functions. This function can be used alone or along with the AnnKey Searchbox.

3. **Context:** 

4. **Size:** This dropdown, as in the query pane, controls the number of hits per page. 

5. **Window:** This dropdown, as in the query pane, controls the number of items around a hit in context.

6. **TimeRange:** This dropdown opens a calendar pane, allowing the user to select a time span in which the annotations retrieved were made.
The data retrieved will only show annotation made between these dates, allowing for specified review of a set of annotations. This can be 
cleared through the use of the associated eraser button.

7. **Users:** This dropdown opens a set of tickboxes corresponding to users' accounts in Cosycat. Marking one or more of these tickboxes
constrains the results of a query to those annotations made by the marked users. This can be  cleared through the use of the associated 
eraser button.

8. **Corpora:** This dropdown opens a set of tickboxes corresponding to separate corpora in the database. Marking one or more of these tickboxes
constrains the results of a query to those annotations made within a particular corpus. This can be cleared through the use of the associa

9. **Search:** This button searches the database for the criteria specified through the use of the other functions in the review pane. The results
are then displayed below in the 'Review Results Pane'. These results can be cleared through the use of the corresponding eraser button.

## **Review Results Pane**

Once the query criteria are entered, the results appear below the searchbar in a similar configuration to the Annotation Pane elsewhere in 
Cosycat. They are listed focusing on the queried annotation with the specified amount of context surrounding it. All annotations on the hit
are displayed, the queried annotation highlighted in orange. The interface here is identical to that in the annotation pane; the primary functions
are repeated here for clarity.
 
1. **Pagination:** The arrows and list of numbers above the results allow the navigation between pages of results.

2. **Context Bar:** Above the annotations for each hit, the text data is shown in context. The hit and its table of annotations can hidden by clicking
this bar, leaving only the text data.

3. **Annotation Markers:** Exhibited in the table of annotations beneath each hit are the annotations associated with the text data. By clicking on them,
users can open the annotation, in the form of a pop-up pane, and view the author and timestamp of the annotation as well as edit it by clicking
its value text.

4. **Context Arrows:** The context arrows allow for the expansion of the hit context on either side of the focus of the query. Clicking
The right-facing arrow will expand the context, one token at a time to the right of the hit token, and the left-facing arrow
will expand it to the right.

Through querying annotations and reviewing them in this pane they can be edited and fine-grain qualitative analysis of individual annotations. 
As well as this, focusing on time period or particular users allows for oversight both of one's own work as well as by project leaders and 
supervisors.
