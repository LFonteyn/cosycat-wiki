Welcome to the cosycat.wiki repository. The reason why this exists is basically
to support a pull-request based approach to wiki editing (by default GitHub-wikis
will only allow either edits by project collaborators or by anyone - which you can
configure in the main repository settings).

Here, we instead follow the approach described [here](https://nerds.inn.org/2014/05/19/applying-git-to-github-wikis/), which can easily be extended to the approach described
[here](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2016/07/enabling-pull-requests-on-github-wikis.html) for automatic sync of merged pull-requests using CI builds.

If you want to collaborate, you need to fork this repository (https://github.com/emanjavacas/cosycat-wiki), and issue a pull-request with your edits.
