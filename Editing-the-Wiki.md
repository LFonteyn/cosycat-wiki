# Editing the Wiki

We use a pull-request/merge approach for Wiki editing.
This means that we will assume some basic working knowdlege of
[git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Setup

### Fork the wiki repository
You will need to fork the wiki repository before before you can start editing.
If you don't know what forking means in GitHub lingo, you can read
[this]() or you can just trust me when I say that a "forked" repository is your
personal copy of someone else's repository stored remotely at GitHub.

- Login with your GitHub account.
- Visit the [cosycat-wiki](https://github.com/emanjavacas/cosycat-wiki) repository.
- Click on the fork button on the upper-right.

### Edit your repository fork

### Issue a pull-request to your fork upstream (e.g. main repository)
